# My Technology Consulting Services

*I offer a range of IT consulting and support services focused on improving your **bottom line**. Each service is available in **Basic (accessible)**, **Standard (midrange)**, and **Premium** tiers – so whether you’re a budget-conscious nonprofit or a client looking for comprehensive high-end solutions, I have an option for you. Below is the full list of services I provide, with descriptions and fair estimated pricing for each tier.*

## Virtual CIO & IT Strategy Leadership

I will act as your on-demand **Chief Information Officer**, helping you plan and execute a technology strategy that fuels your business growth. This means you get executive-level IT guidance without the full-time cost (hiring a full-time CIO can cost well over \$150k/year). I’ll evaluate your current systems, identify ways to save money (like eliminating wasteful tools or licenses), and ensure your tech investments directly support your goals. In short, I bring **12+ years of IT leadership experience** to make sure your technology makes you more efficient, secure, and profitable – at a fraction of the cost of a traditional CIO.

* **Basic (Strategic Tech Check-Up) – \~\$500 one-time:** I will review your current IT setup and business needs, then provide a **roadmap** with key recommendations. This is an affordable one-time strategy session for organizations that need direction. You’ll get a prioritized action plan on how to cut costs and improve operations with technology.
* **Standard (Fractional CIO Advisory) – \~\$1,500 per month:** I become your part-time CIO on-call. This includes **monthly strategy calls, planning of IT budgets**, and ongoing advice as you implement changes. I’ll help you align tech projects with your business plan and proactively suggest improvements. *Predictable retainers like this are popular for small businesses working within tight budgets.*
* **Premium (Fully-Integrated vCIO Partner) – \~\$3,000 per month:** I join your leadership team in an ongoing capacity. I’ll **quarterback all your technology initiatives** – from overseeing IT vendors and projects to implementing policies and security. You get enterprise-grade strategic planning (network, cybersecurity, software roadmap, etc.) tailored to your business. This level ensures your company has top-tier IT leadership continuously steering it forward (yet it’s still far cheaper than a full-time CIO).

## On-Demand IT Support & Troubleshooting

I will **fix your computer issues and tech glitches** on an as-needed basis. If technology problems are slowing you down – whether it’s a virus infection, email not working, or network troubles – I’ll get you back up and running. Quick, reliable support means less downtime for your business, which directly saves you money and frustration. Think of this service as having a friendly IT expert “on call” when things go wrong, without the expense of a full IT staff. I handle the nerdy stuff so you can focus on your actual work.

* **Basic (Quick Fix Session) – \~\$100 per incident:** For a **single issue**, I’ll diagnose and resolve it remotely (or in-person if local). This could be removing a malware infection, troubleshooting a printer or Wi-Fi problem, fixing software errors, etc. It’s a one-time, low-cost service to get you out of a jam.
* **Standard (Small Biz Support Pack) – \~\$300 for 4 hours:** A bundle of support hours at a discounted rate for when you have *multiple* tech issues or devices to service. Use it over time for things like computer tune-ups, setting up new equipment, or ongoing minor fixes. This ensures you have help available for a few different needs (and at an hourly rate well below typical IT consulting fees).
* **Premium (Priority IT Support Retainer) – \~\$1,000 per month:** **Unlimited on-call support** within a month for your business’s tech needs, with priority response. I will be essentially your part-time IT helpdesk – available to quickly solve issues, perform regular maintenance, updates, and monitor your systems’ health. This proactive approach means problems are fixed *before* they impact your operations, minimizing costly downtime.

## Hourly Tech Consulting & Advice

I will be your go-to **technology advisor** by the hour. Have questions about what software to use, how to improve a process, or whether a certain tech investment is worth it? Need a second opinion on an IT proposal or just someone to explain something in plain English? I’m here to help. Instead of spending days researching or making costly trial-and-error mistakes, you can get expert answers **on demand**. This service is flexible and personalized – you set the agenda, and I provide clarity and guidance that can save you time and money. *(For reference, typical IT consultants charge around \$85–\$125/hour for general expertise, and my rates below are in line with that given my experience level.)*

* **Basic (30-Minute Q\&A Call) – \~\$75:** Perfect for **quick questions or troubleshooting advice**. In a focused call, you can “ask me anything” tech-related – whether it’s to review a quote you got, get help deciding between two products, or solve a small issue. This is a budget-friendly option for those who just need a bit of expert input.
* **Standard (1-Hour Deep Dive) – \~\$150:** A full hour of consulting to tackle your challenges in depth. We can screen-share or go step-by-step on a problem, brainstorm solutions for improving part of your business, or even do a mini training. This is great for slightly larger questions like planning a simple tech project, choosing software, or optimizing a workflow. (Hourly consulting at this rate is a fair value – for comparison, independent IT consultants often bill up to \~\$100+ per hour.)
* **Premium (Full-Day Advisory or Training) – \~\$1,000:** Need extensive help or support for a day? This premium package gets you **up to 8 hours** of my time in a single day (onsite at your location or virtually) devoted to your needs. This could be me working through a laundry list of tech fixes, doing a deep audit of your operations, or providing in-depth training to you or your staff. It’s essentially a day-long engagement where I’m part of your team, solving problems and setting you up for long-term success.

## IT Project Management & Implementation Support

I will **manage your IT projects** to ensure they are delivered on-time, on-budget, and with real results. Small businesses often undertake projects like installing a new system, migrating to a new software platform, or upgrading infrastructure – but without proper project management, these initiatives can run late, go over budget, or fail to deliver value. That’s where I come in. With my extensive background leading complex tech projects (I’m a certified PMP and have led cross-functional projects at Fortune 500 companies), I will handle the planning, coordination, and execution details. You get the benefits of a dedicated project manager who speaks both tech and business, making sure the project achieves your desired outcome. *(For example, I led a payroll system migration that **reclaimed 20+ hours per month** for the finance team by streamlining their process – this is the kind of efficiency and impact I aim to bring to your projects.)*

* **Basic (Project Planning Workshop) – \~\$500:** This is a **one-time session to plan out your project**. I’ll work with you to clarify goals, define requirements, and create a high-level roadmap or task list. Essentially, I set you up with a solid project plan and actionable next steps if you prefer to execute with your own team. It’s a low-cost way to get expert planning and avoid costly missteps from the start.
* **Standard (Part-Time Project Oversight) – \~\$1,500 per project:** I provide **ongoing guidance and check-ins** for the duration of a small-to-medium project. We’ll kick off together, and I’ll be involved at key milestones (e.g. vendor selection, testing, launch). I ensure things stay on track and address risks or issues as they arise. This is ideal if you have people to do the hands-on work but need a seasoned manager to steer them – preventing delays and scope creep that often plague DIY projects.
* **Premium (End-to-End Project Leadership) – \~\$3,000+ per project:** I will **fully manage the entire project** from inception to completion. That includes building the schedule, coordinating all stakeholders/vendors, monitoring the budget, and driving the project to success. You basically hand me the project, and I’ll deliver the results. This level often pays for itself: by executing projects effectively, you avoid wasteful spending and get to the benefits faster. (As a reference point, project management consultants typically charge \$70–\$150/hour, so for a complex multi-week project this is a fair investment for professional oversight.)

## Workflow Automation & AI Integration Solutions

I will streamline your business processes by **automating repetitive tasks and integrating AI tools**, so you and your team can save time and reduce errors. Every business has mundane tasks – data entry, report generation, email follow-ups, etc. – that eat up hours. I specialize in finding clever ways to let software or AI handle these chores. This could mean setting up an automation that takes info from one system to another, creating a script to generate a report automatically, or even building a custom AI chatbot to handle common customer questions. The bottom-line impact is often dramatic: by letting technology take over grunt work, you free your staff to focus on higher-value activities. *(In fact, in a previous role I built automations that cut certain task times by 50%, and I launched an AI chatbot that **handled 40% of inbound customer inquiries automatically** – imagine reducing your workload almost by half in some areas!)*

* **Basic (Single-Task Automation) – \~\$300:** I will automate **one manual task or process** for you. For example, set up a workflow that automatically emails a report every week, or a Zapier/Integromat script that syncs customer form entries to a spreadsheet. This is a quick win: one annoying task off your plate, done reliably by a machine. It’s affordable and usually pays back immediately in time saved.
* **Standard (Custom AI/Workflow Solution) – \~\$1,000:** A more **involved automation or AI solution** tailored to your business. This could be a chatbot that answers FAQs for your customers, an AI-powered tool that helps you sort or analyze data, or an integration that ties together multiple systems (like your website, CRM, and email marketing). I’ll design, build, and implement the solution, and then train you on how to use it. The goal here is to eliminate a **multi-step workflow** or a significant portion of someone’s job that can be handled with technology. (These kinds of improvements can yield huge ROI – e.g. one client’s automated chat assistant now resolves nearly half of support queries on its own, saving the team tons of hours.)
* **Premium (End-to-End Business Automation Suite) – \~\$5,000:** A comprehensive package where I **transform multiple processes across your organization** using automation and AI. We’ll identify key areas that, once automated, will drastically improve efficiency (from finance to marketing to operations). I will create a suite of integrated tools or bots, set up dashboards to monitor them, and provide ongoing support/tweaks. This is essentially a mini “digital transformation” for your company. While it’s a larger investment, the returns can be substantial – you might reduce labor hours, eliminate errors, and even unlock new capabilities. (Many businesses see this as an investment that pays off many times over; using data and automation can increase operating margins by over 60% in some cases.)

## Data Analysis & Business Intelligence

I will help you turn your **data into actionable insights**. Small businesses often accumulate data – sales figures, customer feedback, website analytics, etc. – but struggle to make sense of it. I offer data analysis and business intelligence services that shine a light on what’s really happening in your organization. The benefit? You gain knowledge to make smarter decisions that can **boost profits or cut costs**. For example, by analyzing operational data you might find a bottleneck that’s slowing deliveries, or by examining sales trends you might discover a customer segment that’s more profitable to target. I’ll not only do the analysis, but also present it in plain language with visuals (charts, dashboards) so you can clearly see opportunities for improvement. *Remember, businesses that embrace data-driven decision-making significantly outperform those that don’t – one study found companies using data analytics had an **8% increase in profits and 10% reduction in costs** on average.*

* **Basic (Data Insights Report) – \~\$300:** Give me a specific dataset or a business question, and I will perform a **one-time analysis** and provide a report of findings. This might be analyzing last quarter’s sales to find trends, reviewing website traffic to see which marketing is effective, or calculating some key performance metrics for you. You’ll get a concise report or memo with clear findings and a couple of recommendations. It’s a low-cost way to get expert eyes on your data for one particular need.
* **Standard (Dashboard & Metrics Setup) – \~\$1,000:** I will create an **interactive dashboard or a set of automated reports** for your business. Instead of a one-off analysis, you’ll have a living tool (for example, a Google Data Studio/Looker or Excel dashboard) that updates regularly with your latest data. This could include charts of your monthly sales, inventory levels, customer acquisition metrics – whatever matters to you. I also include training on how to use and maintain the dashboard. This empowers you to continuously monitor your business health, much like having a custom speedometer for your company.
* **Premium (Advanced Analytics & Strategy) – \~\$2,500:** A deep-dive engagement where I not only analyze your data, but also help you build a **data-driven strategy**. This might involve predictive analytics (forecasting future trends), segmenting your customers to target the most profitable groups, or identifying inefficiencies in operations through data. I’ll work closely with your team over a period (several weeks or months) to implement data collection if needed, perform complex analyses, and hold strategy sessions around the insights. The goal is to uncover hidden opportunities or problems and guide you in exploiting or fixing them. Many small businesses don’t realize how much money they leave on the table without proper analysis – this package aims to unlock that value and give you a competitive edge.

## Cloud Migration & Infrastructure Optimization

I will help you **leverage cloud technology** and optimize your IT infrastructure to save money and improve reliability. If you have servers gathering dust in a closet, or you’re paying for hardware and maintenance that’s costly, moving to modern cloud services can be a game-changer. I’ll assess your current environment and identify how to reduce expenses (e.g., by eliminating under-utilized hardware or shifting to cheaper cloud storage) and increase uptime. Then I’ll actually help you execute the migration or improvements with minimal disruption. You’ll only pay for what you actually need, and gain flexibility to scale as you grow. *Case in point: I previously **reduced a company’s infrastructure costs by \$10K per year** by optimizing their backup systems and moving workloads to the cloud. Those are real savings that directly improve your bottom line.*

* **Basic (Cloud Readiness Assessment) – \~\$300:** I conduct a **review of your current IT setup** and outline how (and if) cloud solutions could benefit you. Maybe you’re worried about server crashes or you’re simply overpaying for on-site equipment – I’ll give you a cost-benefit analysis, security considerations, and a high-level migration plan. This is a straightforward consultation that produces a roadmap and budget estimate for moving to cloud or upgrading your infrastructure.
* **Standard (Cloud Migration Support) – \~\$1,200 per system:** I will **hands-on help move one of your systems to the cloud** or optimize a major part of your infrastructure. For example, migrate your file storage to a cloud drive, move an on-premise app to a cloud platform, or set up a cloud backup/disaster recovery solution. This includes planning, execution, and basic training for your team on the new setup. The result is typically immediate cost savings (no more physical server upkeep) and improved performance. *Many small businesses pay \$500–\$5,000 monthly for managed IT including cloud services; with this one-time project you might drastically lower those ongoing costs by simplifying your IT footprint.*
* **Premium (End-to-End Infrastructure Overhaul) – \~\$3,000+:** A comprehensive **modernization of your IT infrastructure**. I’ll migrate multiple systems and services to the cloud, consolidate hardware, implement cost-monitoring tools, and ensure your network and systems are configured for peak efficiency. Essentially, I become your project lead to transform your old setup into a scalable, cloud-first infrastructure. This includes coordinating with cloud providers, minimizing downtime during cut-overs, and verifying everything works seamlessly in the new environment. The investment here can often be recouped in the subsequent year or two of lower operating costs. Plus, you gain improved security and reliability (most major cloud platforms have built-in redundancy and cybersecurity that would be costly to do on your own).

## Cybersecurity & Risk Assessment

I will strengthen your business’s **cybersecurity** to protect against hackers, malware, and data breaches. Did you know that **43% of cyber attacks target small businesses**? It’s a scary statistic, and unfortunately many small organizations are vulnerable – over 80% of small businesses have experienced a security breach. I offer services to assess your current security posture, implement essential safeguards, and train you and your staff on best practices. My goal is to drastically reduce the risk of a breach that could cost you thousands (the average cyber attack costs a small company over \$8,000 in damages/recovery). By being proactive, you avoid the nightmare of lost data, broken customer trust, and expensive downtime. I stay up-to-date with the latest threats and solutions, so I can **translate cybersecurity into plain English** and pragmatic steps that keep your business safe.

* **Basic (Security Health Check) – \~\$300:** I will perform a **security audit** of your business’s IT. This involves checking your computers and network for common vulnerabilities: is your antivirus active and updated? Are your passwords strong and changed regularly? Do you have backups in place? I’ll then deliver a report of findings with **recommended fixes**. This is a great starter for small orgs who have never had a formal security check – think of it like a wellness exam for your technology.
* **Standard (Hardening & Training Package) – \~\$1,000:** This package not only includes a thorough audit, but also **implementation of critical security measures** and a training session for your team. I will fix the high-priority issues from the audit – for example, setting up a firewall properly, configuring automatic backups, updating outdated software, removing malware, etc. – essentially “locking the doors and windows.” Then, I’ll conduct a one-hour training for your employees on cybersecurity basics (how to spot phishing emails, safe internet habits, password management). Since human error is a leading cause of breaches (about 67% of breaches are caused by credential theft or user mistakes), this training significantly lowers your risk.
* **Premium (Comprehensive Security Management) – \~\$2,500:** I become your part-time **security officer** with ongoing oversight. This includes regular vulnerability scans, 24/7 monitoring setup (where feasible) for intrusions, incident response planning (so if something does happen, you have a plan), and periodic security policy reviews to keep you compliant with any regulations in your industry. I will also help you get set up with advanced protections as needed – such as multi-factor authentication across all your tools, encryption for sensitive data, and even cyber insurance guidance. With this premium service, you can confidently tell customers that you take data security seriously. It’s like having a cybersecurity department, scaled to a small business budget. One breach can be devastating, so this is peace of mind that your risk is as low as possible.

## Website Development & Online Presence

I will create or improve your **website and online presence** to help you reach more customers and increase sales. In today’s digital-first world, a strong website isn’t optional – it’s often how people first judge your business. A professional, user-friendly site with good SEO can attract new customers while you sleep. I focus on building sites that are **clean, modern, and optimized** for both desktop and mobile, so you make the right impression. Whether you need a simple informational website or a full e-commerce store, I can deliver a solution that fits your budget. I also ensure your site is secure and easy to update. Remember, *a strong online presence is critical for attracting customers and building credibility*, especially for small businesses competing against larger rivals. Let’s turn your website into a 24/7 salesperson for your brand.

* **Basic (Starter Website or Landing Page) – \~\$500:** A **simple one-page website** or landing page to establish your online presence. This is perfect if you’re just starting out or only need a digital business card. I will use a template or straightforward design: it will include your logo, a description of services, contact info, and maybe a basic contact form or map. Despite being basic, it will look professional and load fast. This low-cost option is great for getting something online quickly that you can build upon later.
* **Standard (Business Website) – \~\$1,500:** A **multi-page small business website** tailored to your brand. Typically 5–10 pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.), custom design elements to match your style, and integration of any tools you need (for example, a scheduling plugin, or a newsletter signup). I’ll also do basic on-page SEO (like setting up your titles, meta descriptions, and site map) so that search engines can find you. The result is a polished site that gives customers confidence in your business. It’s built so you can edit content yourself after launch (I can use platforms like WordPress or Wix, depending on your preference). Businesses with quality websites often see improved customer trust and higher engagement – your website will finally be an asset, not an embarrassment.
* **Premium (E-Commerce or Advanced Web Solution) – \~\$3,000:** A **comprehensive online platform** for your business. This could be an e-commerce store with payment integration, inventory management, etc., or a more complex site with custom features (member logins, databases, integrations with other services). I will handle everything from initial design mockups to setting up the backend, and provide training on how to manage your site (add products or edit content). Furthermore, I’ll implement advanced SEO techniques and performance optimizations so that your site ranks well and loads quickly. This premium package is for clients who view their website as a critical piece of their business model – you’ll get a top-notch site comparable to “big company” quality. *(And don’t worry, even at this level, the cost is still probably less than a big agency would charge – I keep it fair while delivering high-end results.)*

## Employee Tech Training & Workshops

I will **train you and your employees** to use technology more efficiently and safely. Often, the biggest technology challenges in an organization aren’t the hardware or software – it’s making sure people know how to use the tools properly and follow best practices. With this service, I offer hands-on training sessions and workshops on a variety of topics: from general digital literacy (for example, how to organize files, use spreadsheets effectively) and productivity hacks, to specialized training (like using a specific software your team just adopted, or educating staff on cybersecurity awareness). Well-trained teams work faster and make fewer mistakes, which directly improves your bottom line. *In fact, companies that invest in employee development **report 11% higher profitability** on average, because training boosts productivity and morale.* I’m passionate about teaching (I’ve mentored junior staff in my career and led many workshops), so I make the sessions engaging, clear, and tailored to your audience’s skill level.

* **Basic (1-Hour Training Session) – \~\$200:** A focused **training session for individuals or a small team** on a topic of your choice. This could be done virtually or in-person (if local). Perhaps you need someone to walk your non-technical staff through using a new software tool, or you want a crash course on Excel formulas, or a basic introduction to AI tools like ChatGPT for business. In one hour, I can cover key concepts, do a live demo, and leave time for Q\&A. Participants will also get a cheat-sheet or reference guide to help them remember what they learned. This is a cost-effective way to address a specific knowledge gap.
* **Standard (Half-Day Workshop) – \~\$600:** A **3-4 hour workshop** that allows for deeper exploration and hands-on practice. This is ideal for training a group of employees on more complex tools or multiple topics. For example, a half-day “Digital Boost Camp” where we cover several productivity tools, or an interactive security awareness workshop with phishing email drills. I include interactive exercises so attendees actually try things out during the session (studies show people retain more that way). By the end, your team will not only understand but also *feel comfortable* with the subject matter. This level of training can significantly improve daily efficiency – for instance, if everyone learns shortcuts and features in software they use, the time savings add up across the whole team.
* **Premium (Customized Training Program) – \~\$1,500:** I will develop and deliver a **comprehensive training program** spread over multiple sessions or topics, completely customized to your organization. We’ll start by identifying your goals and skill gaps. Then I might design a curriculum that spans, say, 4 weekly sessions (could be one per week) covering everything from basic IT troubleshooting (to reduce calls for help), to advanced use of your specific industry software, to forward-looking skills (like data analysis or automation for your staff). I’ll include pre-training and post-training assessments to measure improvement, and provide detailed documentation or even video recordings for future reference. This is essentially me working as your part-time corporate trainer for a period of time. The investment can yield a massive ROI – your employees will be empowered to use technology to its fullest, work more independently, and even innovate. Plus, offering training shows employees you’re investing in their growth, which improves retention and job satisfaction (happier, more capable employees often translate into better output and service for your customers).
