# Where Systems Meet Humanity

I operate at the intersection where **technical excellence meets human reality**. While others chase the latest tech trends, I focus on what actually works—building systems that serve people, not shareholders. I've spent 12+ years proving that you can deliver measurable business outcomes while maintaining your soul (and sense of humor).

## Who I Am

I'm a **Senior Technical Program Manager** who believes the best transformations happen when you combine deep technical knowledge with genuine empathy. I lead cross-functional initiatives that don't just check boxes—they **solve real problems, empower teams, and occasionally expose the beautiful absurdity of corporate tech**.

### The Professional

- **12+ years** leading technology transformations that actually stick
- **PMP and Product Management certified** (because credentials matter, even when they're arbitrary)
- **Saved 20+ hours/month** for a global payroll team through strategic system migration
- **Expert in Agile, Scrum, and knowing when to ignore both**
- **Specialist in systems integration** and making disparate tools play nicely together

### The Human

- **Questions why we accept broken systems** as "just how things work"
- **Champions equity and accessibility** in every solution—it's not optional
- **Mentors teams** because lifting others up is how we all rise
- **Finds dry humor** in the contradictions of modern tech capitalism
- **Believes in radical transparency** (yes, even about project risks)

## What I Do

I don't just manage projects—I **transform how organizations think about technology**. My approach? Clear-eyed realism paired with relentless optimism.

### Recent Wins

- **Global payroll system migration** that actually improved people's lives (novel concept, I know)
- **Launched compliance tools** that teams actually want to use
- **Streamlined workflows** without the usual consultant buzzword bingo
- **Built inclusive environments** where diverse voices drive better solutions
- **Delivered 0% project strategy rejection rate** (turns out, listening to stakeholders works)

};
```

## The Journey

### Foundation: Business Meets Tech

Started with a Business degree and IT concentration from Hofstra. Quickly discovered that understanding both sides of the equation—business needs and technical possibilities—was my superpower.

### Evolution: From Projects to Purpose

Spent years learning that successful transformation isn't about the technology—it's about **people, processes, and occasionally calling out the emperor's new clothes**.

### Current Chapter: Building Better

Now I focus on helping organizations create technology solutions that are **secure, private, accessible, and actually useful**. No compromises on the fundamentals.

## Philosophy

### Authentic Expertise

I bring **clear, no-nonsense authority** grounded in real experience. No fluff, no jargon gymnastics—just honest assessment and practical solutions.

### Optimistic Problem-Solving

Yes, modern tech can be dystopian. But dwelling on that doesn't help anyone. I focus on **empowering teams through knowledge and sustainable action**.

### Equity at the Core

Every solution should work for everyone. **Accessibility and inclusion** aren't features—they're foundations.

## Working With Me

### What I Bring

- **Strategic thinking** that connects technical decisions to business outcomes
- **Relationship management** that turns skeptics into champions
- **Risk mitigation** that's proactive, not paranoid
- **Change leadership** that brings people along for the journey
- **Honest communication** wrapped in just enough humor to keep it human

### What I Value

- **Security, privacy, and UX** as non-negotiables
- **Transparency** over corporate theater
- **Sustainable solutions** over quick fixes
- **Team empowerment** over hero culture
- **Results that matter** to actual humans

## Let's Transform Something

I'm drawn to opportunities that:

- **Challenge the status quo** of how technology serves organizations
- **Solve real problems** without creating new ones
- **Respect the fundamentals** of security, privacy, and accessibility
- **Value long-term thinking** over quarterly metrics
- **Embrace the messy reality** of organizational change

Whether you're modernizing legacy systems, launching new initiatives, or trying to make sense of your tech chaos, I bring both the **technical expertise** and **human-centered approach** needed to create lasting transformation.

Because at the end of the day, technology is just a tool. What matters is how we use it to make work—and life—a little bit better.
