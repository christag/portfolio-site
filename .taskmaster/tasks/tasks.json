The solution requires implementing CSS custom properties for design tokens that work seamlessly with both Tailwind utilities and scoped styles. Theme switching should be handled through data attributes with CSS variables rather than switching between custom token classes and standard Tailwind classes. Component-specific effects should utilize Astro's scoped styles to prevent conflicts while maintaining consistency. Design tokens must be synchronized between CSS variables and Tailwind configuration to ensure a unified theming approach that leverages Tailwind's utility classes for layout and interactions while using CSS variables for dynamic theming.\n</info added on 2025-07-09T18:11:56.728Z>",
