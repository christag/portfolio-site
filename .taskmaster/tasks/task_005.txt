# Task ID: 5
# Title: Deploy Headless CMS (Strapi) on AWS with Robust Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: highest
# Description: Set up and deploy Strapi as the headless CMS on AWS EC2 (t3.micro or higher as needed) with content models for Media, Service (with tiered pricing, descriptions, feature highlights, pin/highlight, slug, filtering, dynamic CTA), Bio, and SiteSettings. This is the highest priority task and must be completed before any dynamic services or portfolio features. The Service model must support filtering by service type and pricing tier, pin/highlight functionality, and dynamic CTA generation based on contactMethod. Performance considerations such as caching, error handling, and loading states are required. Subtasks have been reordered based on risk assessment and critical path optimization to minimize blockers and enable parallel work where possible.
# Details:
1. Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform:
   - EC2 t3.micro (or higher if required for performance)
   - S3 bucket for asset storage
   - Security groups and IAM roles
2. Apply security hardening immediately after infrastructure provisioning to minimize risk exposure
3. Set up backup and recovery procedures before any data is created
4. Install and configure Strapi CMS:
   - Set up with SQLite initially (PostgreSQL upgrade-ready)
   - Use pre-configured AMI or manual setup as appropriate[1][3][5]
5. Define content models in Strapi:
   - Media: id, title, type(enum), url, embedCode, tags[], length, createdAt
   - Service: id, title, category/type, description, featureHighlights[], tiers[{name (Basic/Standard/Premium), priceLow, priceHigh, deliverables}], contactMethod, isPinned, slug
   - Service model must support filtering by service type and pricing tier, pin/highlight functionality, and dynamic CTA generation based on contactMethod
   - Bio: markdown, socialLinks[]
   - SiteSettings: various configuration options
6. Configure API endpoints (GraphQL and REST, as supported by Strapi)
   - Ensure endpoints support filtering, sorting, and dynamic CTA logic for Service
7. Set up user authentication and permissions in Strapi
8. Configure S3 for media uploads via Strapi's upload provider
9. Implement caching strategies, error handling, and monitoring in parallel
10. Conduct performance and load testing
11. Document all architecture and processes

CRITICAL: This CMS deployment blocks all dynamic content functionality and should be prioritized over other tasks. Security and backup procedures are now prioritized early in the process to minimize risk.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Strapi installation and accessibility
2. Test content model creation and validation in Strapi, especially Service model fields (title, description, category/type, tiered pricing, feature highlights, contactMethod, isPinned, slug)
3. Validate Strapi API endpoints (REST/GraphQL) return expected data, including filtering by service type and pricing tier, and dynamic CTA logic
4. Test media upload functionality to S3 via Strapi
5. Verify backup system works correctly
6. Load test to ensure t3.micro (or chosen instance) performance is adequate
7. Check security configurations and access controls in Strapi
8. Test caching and error handling for all API endpoints
9. Validate loading states for all dynamic content
10. Review CSS variable and Tailwind integration in CMS-driven UI
11. Verify security hardening measures are effective
12. Test disaster recovery procedures
