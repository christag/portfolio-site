# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement PWA Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Add Progressive Web App capabilities including installability, offline access, and push notifications, following a complexity-based implementation approach from foundation to advanced features.
# Details:
Implementation follows a structured approach:

**FOUNDATION (Basic PWA Infrastructure):**
1. Create manifest.json file with comprehensive PWA configuration
2. Generate optimized app icons for all required sizes
3. Implement service worker for offline functionality

**INSTALLATION & ENGAGEMENT (User Experience):**
4. Handle install prompt and ensure cross-platform installability
5. Set up push notifications with Strapi 5 and AWS integration

**ADVANCED FEATURES (Enhanced Functionality):**
6. Implement offline content sync and background sync capabilities

**QUALITY ASSURANCE (Validation & Testing):**
7. Perform comprehensive cross-device and cross-browser testing
8. Run Lighthouse PWA audit and address all recommendations

This approach ensures each layer builds upon the previous, creating a robust PWA implementation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify PWA installability on desktop and mobile after foundation setup
2. Test offline functionality by disabling network after service worker implementation
3. Validate service worker registration and updates
4. Test push notification functionality with Strapi 5 integration
5. Verify manifest.json is correctly configured and served
6. Test on various browsers and devices during QA phase
7. Validate Lighthouse PWA score meets 100% compliance
8. Test offline sync capabilities with real-world scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create and Validate manifest.json [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive manifest.json file tailored for Astro, ensuring all required fields for installability and branding are present. Include multiple icon sizes (192x192, 512x512, maskable), theme color, background color, display mode, and start URL. Integrate with Astro's build process and validate using Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools.
### Details:
Follow latest PWA standards for manifest fields. Ensure icons are referenced correctly and support maskable icons for adaptive layouts. Test manifest recognition and install prompt eligibility in Chrome and Edge. Confirm manifest.json is served with correct MIME type and accessible at the root.

## 2. Generate and Optimize App Icons [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Design a set of glassmorphism-inspired, punk-meets-professional icons in required sizes and formats (PNG, SVG, maskable). Optimize for performance (compression, modern formats like WebP/AVIF) and accessibility (sufficient contrast, alt text for fallback). Integrate icons into manifest.json and Astro static assets.
### Details:
Use Figma or similar tools for icon design. Validate icon appearance on various devices and OS install surfaces. Test maskable icon rendering. Run Lighthouse to check icon compliance and performance impact.

## 3. Implement and Test Service Worker [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop a robust service worker using Workbox or custom code, tailored for Astro's static/dynamic content and Strapi 5 API endpoints. Implement cache-first for static assets, network-first or stale-while-revalidate for dynamic content. Ensure versioning and update logic. Register service worker in Astro entry point.
### Details:
Test offline support by simulating network loss and verifying cached content loads. Validate service worker registration and update flow in DevTools. Ensure HTTPS is enforced on AWS deployment. Use Lighthouse to confirm offline readiness.

## 4. Handle Install Prompt and Installability [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement custom install prompt logic using the beforeinstallprompt event. Provide a branded, accessible UI for prompting users to install the PWA. Ensure prompt only appears when install criteria are met. Track install events for analytics.
### Details:
Test install prompt on Chrome, Edge, and Android. Validate that the app is installable via Lighthouse and that the prompt is accessible (keyboard, screen reader). Confirm manifest and service worker requirements are met for installability.

## 5. Set Up Push Notifications with Strapi 5 and AWS [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Integrate push notification support using the Push API and Strapi 5 as the backend. Implement subscription logic in the service worker and client, store subscriptions in Strapi, and use AWS SNS or SES for scalable push delivery. Provide opt-in UI and manage user permissions.
### Details:
Test push subscription, delivery, and notification display on multiple devices. Ensure notifications are actionable, branded, and accessible. Validate permission handling and fallback for unsupported browsers. Use Lighthouse and manual tests to confirm push support.

## 6. Implement Offline Content Sync and Background Sync [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Enable offline content creation and background sync using service worker Background Sync API. Queue user actions (e.g., form submissions) while offline and sync with Strapi 5 when connectivity is restored. Provide user feedback for sync status.
### Details:
Test offline actions and verify data syncs correctly when back online. Validate sync logic with Strapi endpoints. Ensure UI communicates offline/online state and sync progress. Use Lighthouse and DevTools to confirm offline resilience.

## 7. Cross-Device and Cross-Browser Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Test the PWA on a wide range of devices (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS) and browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox). Validate installability, offline support, push notifications, and UI responsiveness. Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.2, ARIA, keyboard navigation) and glassmorphism effects render correctly.
### Details:
Use BrowserStack or physical devices for testing. Run accessibility audits with Lighthouse and axe. Test with screen readers and high-contrast modes. Validate performance and responsiveness using modern CSS (container queries, prefers-color-scheme). Document and fix cross-device issues.

## 8. Run and Address Lighthouse PWA Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.7
### Description: Perform a comprehensive Lighthouse audit for PWA, performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. Address all critical and recommended issues, focusing on installability, offline support, accessibility, and performance optimization (code splitting, image formats, lazy loading).
### Details:
Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools and CI/CD pipeline. Document audit results and remediation steps. Re-test after fixes to ensure 100% PWA compliance. Validate that all installability and offline support criteria are met.
