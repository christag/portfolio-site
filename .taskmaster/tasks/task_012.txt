# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement PWA Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Add Progressive Web App capabilities including installability, offline access, and push notifications.
# Details:
1. Create manifest.json file:
```json
{
  "name": "Chris's Portfolio & Services",
  "short_name": "Portfolio",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#F5F5F5",
  "theme_color": "#00C6AE",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```
2. Implement comprehensive service worker:
   - Cache static assets
   - Implement offline fallback pages
   - Cache API responses
3. Create app icons in various sizes
4. Add install prompt handling
5. Implement basic push notification support
6. Add offline content sync
7. Test installability across devices

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify PWA installability on desktop and mobile
2. Test offline functionality by disabling network
3. Validate service worker registration and updates
4. Test push notification functionality
5. Verify manifest.json is correctly configured
6. Test on various browsers and devices
7. Validate Lighthouse PWA score

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create manifest.json [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the web app manifest file containing metadata such as app name, icons, theme color, and display settings. Ensure it is placed in the root directory and linked in the HTML head.
### Details:
Include required fields like name, short_name, icons (multiple sizes), start_url, display, background_color, and theme_color.

## 2. Generate App Icons [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Design and export app icons in various required sizes (e.g., 512x512px, 192x192px) in PNG format and reference them in the manifest.json.
### Details:
Ensure icons are optimized for different devices and platforms, and verify their inclusion in the manifest file.

## 3. Implement Service Worker [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop and register a service worker script to enable offline capabilities, caching, and background processes.
### Details:
Implement caching strategies for static assets and fallback mechanisms for offline access.

## 4. Handle Install Prompt [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.3
### Description: Implement logic to detect and display the PWA install prompt to users, ensuring a smooth installation experience.
### Details:
Listen for the 'beforeinstallprompt' event and provide a custom UI to encourage installation.

## 5. Set Up Push Notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Configure push notification support using the service worker, including subscription management and notification display.
### Details:
Integrate with a push service, request user permission, and handle incoming push events in the service worker.

## 6. Implement Offline Content Sync [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Enable background sync and offline content updates using the service worker to ensure data consistency when connectivity is restored.
### Details:
Use Background Sync API or similar mechanisms to queue and synchronize data changes made while offline.

## 7. Conduct Cross-Device Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6
### Description: Test the PWA across various devices, browsers, and operating systems to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
### Details:
Verify installation, offline functionality, push notifications, and UI responsiveness on multiple platforms.

## 8. Validate with Lighthouse PWA Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run Lighthouse audits to evaluate PWA compliance, performance, accessibility, and best practices, and address any identified issues.
### Details:
Iterate on the implementation based on Lighthouse feedback to achieve a high PWA score.
