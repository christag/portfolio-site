# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Astro, configure tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Husky), and set up CI/CD pipeline to Cloudflare Pages with preview branches.
# Details:
1. Create a new GitHub repository (private)
2. Initialize project with Astro framework
3. Configure ESLint with Astro-specific recommended rules
4. Set up Prettier for code formatting with Astro settings
5. Implement Husky for pre-commit hooks
6. Create GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to:
   - Build the Astro project
   - Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
   - Set up preview branches for PRs
7. Configure basic 404 page and SEO defaults using Astro's static output
8. Add README.md with project overview and Astro-specific setup instructions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all tooling works locally (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
2. Test GitHub Actions workflow by pushing a commit
3. Confirm successful deployment to Cloudflare Pages
4. Validate preview branch functionality by creating a test PR
5. Check 404 page is properly served for non-existent routes
6. Verify Astro's static output performance metrics

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new private GitHub repository for the project, including branch protections and access controls.
### Details:
Create a private GitHub repository. Configure branch protection rules for 'main' branch: require pull request reviews before merging, require status checks to pass before merging, and restrict who can push to matching branches. Set up access permissions following the principle of least privilege, with appropriate roles for solo development that can scale to a small team.

## 2. Initialize Astro Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize the Astro framework within the repository using the Astro CLI.
### Details:
Use the Astro CLI command 'npm create astro@latest' to scaffold the project structure. Select the appropriate template options for a portfolio/business website. Commit the initial codebase to the repository.

## 3. Configure Tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Husky) [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up code quality and formatting tools, including ESLint for linting, Prettier for code formatting, and Husky for Git hooks.
### Details:
Install and configure ESLint with Astro-specific rules using 'eslint-plugin-astro'. Set up Prettier with Astro formatting support using 'prettier-plugin-astro'. Configure Husky to run linting and formatting checks on pre-commit.

## 4. Set Up CI/CD Workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Configure continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.
### Details:
Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml to define pipeline stages for build and deploy. Configure the workflow to use Node.js and install dependencies, build the Astro project with 'npm run build', and prepare for deployment to Cloudflare Pages. Ensure jobs are optimized for speed and reliability.

## 5. Configure Deployment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up deployment scripts and environment configurations for Cloudflare Pages.
### Details:
Configure Cloudflare Pages deployment using Astro's static output mode. Set the build command to 'npm run build' and the output directory to 'dist'. Manage environment variables securely through Cloudflare Pages dashboard. Ensure proper separation of development and production environments.

## 6. Enable Preview Branch Deployments [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy preview environments for feature or pull request branches.
### Details:
Set up Cloudflare Pages preview deployments for pull requests. Configure GitHub Actions workflow to trigger deployments for non-main branches. Ensure preview URLs are posted as comments on pull requests for easy access.

## 7. Set Up 404 Page and SEO Defaults [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement a custom 404 error page and configure default SEO metadata using Astro's capabilities.
### Details:
Create a 404.astro page in the pages directory. Configure default SEO metadata using Astro's built-in SEO features. Set up robots.txt and sitemap.xml using Astro integrations. Leverage Astro's static HTML output for optimal SEO performance.

## 8. Write Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.6, 1.7
### Description: Document the repository structure, Astro-specific setup instructions, CI/CD workflow, deployment process, and contribution guidelines.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive README.md with: project overview, Astro-specific setup instructions, development workflow, deployment process, and contribution guidelines. Include information about the performance benefits of Astro (40% faster loading, 90% less JavaScript), SEO advantages, and Strapi integration capabilities.
