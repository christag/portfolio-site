# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add Animation and Micro-interactions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement subtle motion cues and micro-interactions using GSAP or Framer Motion to enhance the user experience.
# Details:
1. Configure Framer Motion or GSAP library
2. Implement the following animations:
   - Fade-in cards on scroll
   - Progress bar on scroll
   - Button ripple effects
   - Page transitions
   - Hover state animations
3. Create custom hooks for animation control:
```javascript
function useScrollAnimation(ref) {
  // Logic to trigger animations based on scroll position
}
```
4. Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```
5. Lazy-load animation libraries to reduce initial bundle size
6. Create reusable animation components
7. Ensure animations don't interfere with accessibility

# Test Strategy:
1. Test animations across different browsers and devices
2. Verify prefers-reduced-motion support
3. Measure performance impact of animations
4. Test accessibility with animations enabled/disabled
5. Validate animations don't cause layout shifts
6. Test with throttled CPU to ensure smooth performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Animation Library Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and install a suitable React animation library (e.g., Framer Motion) based on project requirements, performance, compatibility, and developer experience.
### Details:
Evaluate libraries for GPU acceleration, SSR support, documentation, and ease of integration. Install the chosen library using npm or yarn.

## 2. Implement Animations by Type [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop and integrate animations for various UI elements (e.g., enter/exit transitions, hover effects, page transitions) using the chosen library.
### Details:
Use the library's API to implement different animation types as required by the UI/UX design.

## 3. Create Custom Animation Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Develop reusable custom React hooks to encapsulate animation logic and simplify usage across components.
### Details:
Abstract common animation patterns into hooks for consistency and maintainability.

## 4. Support Prefers-Reduced-Motion [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Implement logic to detect and respect the user's 'prefers-reduced-motion' system setting, disabling or simplifying animations as needed.
### Details:
Use CSS media queries or JavaScript APIs to check for reduced motion preferences and adjust animation behavior accordingly.

## 5. Lazy-Load Animation Libraries [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Optimize performance by configuring the application to lazy-load animation libraries only when animations are needed.
### Details:
Implement dynamic imports or code-splitting strategies to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times.

## 6. Build Reusable Animation Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Develop modular, reusable animation components that can be easily integrated and customized throughout the application.
### Details:
Encapsulate animation logic and props in well-documented components for consistent use.

## 7. Accessibility Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4, 11.6
### Description: Test and validate that all animations meet accessibility standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and reduced motion support.
### Details:
Conduct manual and automated accessibility testing to ensure compliance and a positive user experience for all users.
