# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add Animation and Micro-interactions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement subtle motion cues and micro-interactions using GSAP or Framer Motion to enhance the user experience, following a complexity-based approach from foundation to validation.
# Details:
1. Configure Framer Motion or GSAP library with accessibility-first approach
2. Implement prefers-reduced-motion support as foundation before animations
3. Implement the following animations:
   - Fade-in cards on scroll
   - Progress bar on scroll
   - Button ripple effects
   - Page transitions
   - Hover state animations
4. Create custom hooks for animation control:
```javascript
function useScrollAnimation(ref) {
  // Logic to trigger animations based on scroll position
}
```
5. Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```
6. Lazy-load animation libraries to reduce initial bundle size
7. Create reusable animation components
8. Ensure animations don't interfere with accessibility
9. Follow complexity-based order: Setup → Accessibility → Implementation → Tools → Performance → Components → Validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test animations across different browsers and devices
2. Verify prefers-reduced-motion support early in development
3. Measure performance impact of animations
4. Test accessibility with animations enabled/disabled
5. Validate animations don't cause layout shifts
6. Test with throttled CPU to ensure smooth performance
7. Validate each phase before moving to the next complexity level

# Subtasks:
## 1. Animation Library Setup and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, select, and integrate animation libraries (e.g., GSAP, Framer Motion) into the Astro 5 project, ensuring compatibility with Strapi 5 content and AWS deployment. Configure libraries for optimal performance and accessibility, including tree-shaking and modular imports.
### Details:
Deliverables: Installed and configured animation libraries; documentation of setup steps. Technical specs: Use Astro's component model, ensure libraries are loaded only where needed, and support both SSR and client-side rendering. Performance: Minimize bundle size, enable code splitting, and lazy-load libraries. Accessibility: Ensure libraries support ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.

## 2. Implement Prefers-Reduced-Motion and Motion Accessibility Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Detect and respect user motion preferences using CSS and JS, providing fallbacks or disabling non-essential animations for users with prefers-reduced-motion enabled. This forms the accessibility foundation before implementing any animations.
### Details:
Deliverables: Global and component-level motion preference checks; documentation of accessible animation patterns. Technical specs: Use CSS media queries and JS APIs to detect preferences. Performance: Avoid loading heavy animation code when motion is reduced. Accessibility: All non-essential animations must be suppressible; provide clear focus indicators and avoid triggering vestibular disorders.

## 3. Implement Animations by Type (Page, Element, Micro-interactions) [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Define and implement animation patterns for page transitions, UI elements (buttons, cards), and micro-interactions (hover, focus, active states) using modern CSS (e.g., prefers-reduced-motion, CSS custom properties) and animation libraries.
### Details:
Deliverables: Animation specs for each type; implemented animations in Astro components. Technical specs: Use Astro's transition directives for page transitions[3], CSS for simple effects, and JS libraries for complex sequences. Performance: Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity), avoid layout thrashing. Accessibility: All animations must respect user motion preferences and not interfere with content readability.

## 4. Develop Custom Animation Hooks and Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Create reusable custom hooks/utilities for managing animation state, sequencing, and event triggers in Astro/React components, with TypeScript typings and documentation.
### Details:
Deliverables: Custom hooks/utilities with tests and usage docs. Technical specs: Hooks should abstract animation logic, support dependency injection, and expose imperative controls. Performance: Ensure hooks do not cause unnecessary re-renders. Accessibility: Hooks must expose APIs for pausing/stopping animations based on accessibility settings.

## 5. Lazy-Load Animation Libraries and Assets [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Implement lazy-loading for animation libraries and assets, ensuring they are only loaded when required (e.g., on interaction or in view), using Astro's code-splitting and dynamic import features.
### Details:
Deliverables: Code demonstrating lazy-loading of animation libraries; performance benchmarks. Technical specs: Use dynamic imports and Astro's partial hydration. Performance: Measure and document impact on initial load and interaction latency. Accessibility: Ensure lazy-loading does not delay essential UI feedback or accessibility features.

## 6. Build Reusable Animation Components for Glassmorphism UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Develop a library of reusable, accessible animation components (e.g., animated cards, modals, buttons) that align with the glassmorphism and punk-meets-professional design, using modern CSS and animation best practices.
### Details:
Deliverables: Component library with usage examples and Storybook documentation. Technical specs: Components must be themeable, composable, and support both CSS and JS-driven animations. Performance: Components should be lightweight and avoid unnecessary reflows. Accessibility: All components must be keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly, and respect motion preferences.

## 7. Accessibility and Performance Validation of Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.6
### Description: Conduct comprehensive accessibility and performance testing of all animations and micro-interactions using automated tools (axe, Lighthouse), manual audits, and user testing. Document issues and implement remediations.
### Details:
Deliverables: Accessibility and performance audit reports; list of remediations and verification steps. Technical specs: Test with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and motion preference settings. Performance: Benchmark animation impact on Core Web Vitals. Accessibility: Ensure WCAG 2.2 compliance, including focus management, reduced motion, and no flashing or distracting effects.
