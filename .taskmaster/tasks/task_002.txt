# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Layout and Theme Components
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop foundational UI components and layouts that properly implement Apple's Liquid Glass design principles with medium-high translucency (60-85% opacity), strong backdrop-filter blur (24-32px), and proper spatial depth. All components must use rounded corners (24px radius), adaptive tinting, and glass materials exclusively - no solid backgrounds. Navigation, footer, typography, and responsive layout system should reflect proper glass layering hierarchy with soft drop shadows, inner highlights, and blending effects between adjacent glass elements.
# Details:
1. Set up Tailwind CSS with custom configuration for proper Liquid Glass implementation with 60-85% opacity and strong blur effects
2. Define CSS variables for design tokens supporting Light and Dark themes with proper glass materials:
   - Glass Materials: 60-85% opacity with 24-32px backdrop-filter blur for containers, 16-24px for buttons
   - Rounded Corners: 24px radius standard for all glass containers
   - Shadows & Highlights: Soft drop shadows and inner highlights for proper depth
   - Adaptive Tinting: Subtle color overlays that respond to content
   - NO solid backgrounds - all separation through glass materials
3. Create layout components:
   - MainLayout.jsx with proper glass layering hierarchy (content → glass controls/containers → overlays)
   - Header/Navigation with proper glass material (60-85% opacity, 24-32px blur) and rounded corners
   - Footer with proper glass implementation matching navigation standards
   - All components must have blending/merging effects between adjacent glass elements
4. Implement responsive breakpoints ensuring glass materials properly obscure underlying content at all sizes
5. Create UI component library:
   - Buttons with proper glass implementation (16-24px blur, rounded corners, adaptive tinting)
   - Cards and containers with 60-85% opacity, 24-32px blur, 24px radius
   - All components must use glass materials exclusively - no solid backgrounds
   - Proper layering hierarchy with content visible through multiple glass layers
6. Add GSAP or Framer Motion for glass-appropriate animations respecting the material properties. All motion must work with glass blur and transparency effects.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test glass materials properly obscure content underneath with 24-32px blur
2. Verify 60-85% opacity levels create proper visual separation without solid backgrounds
3. Test rounded corners (24px) render correctly on all glass elements
4. Validate soft drop shadows and inner highlights create proper depth perception
5. Ensure blending/merging effects work between adjacent glass elements
6. Test adaptive tinting responds appropriately to underlying content
7. Verify proper layering hierarchy: content → glass controls/containers → overlays

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Accessibility Checks for Chaotic Layouts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit all components and layouts for accessibility compliance (WCAG), including keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and equity-driven design, with special attention to high-contrast, chaotic, and glass/translucent layouts. Ensure motion and environmental adaptation features are accessible.
### Details:
Use automated tools and manual testing to verify accessibility standards are met. Ensure design supports empowerment, inclusion, creative expression, and Liquid Glass spatial depth.

## 2. Perform Cross-Browser Testing for Punk/Brutalist UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test all components and layouts across major browsers to ensure consistent appearance, accessibility, and brand-aligned functionality, including punk/brutalist and Liquid Glass effects.
### Details:
Address any browser-specific issues, leveraging Autoprefixer and polyfills where necessary. Validate accessibility, privacy, and visual fidelity of punk/brutalist and glass effects in all environments, including fallback for unsupported backdrop-filter.

## 3. Refactor Theme System to Light/Dark Only [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the punk theme and consolidate to Light and Dark themes only, integrating brutalist/creative and Liquid Glass aesthetic elements directly into both base themes. Update all theme-switching logic and component styling accordingly.
### Details:
1. Remove punk theme from theme switching logic in Navigation component
2. Update CSS variables to support only light and dark themes
3. Integrate punk/brutalist visual elements (glitch effects, asymmetric layouts, bold typography) and glass material system (backdrop-filter, blur, dynamic glow) into both light and dark themes
4. Update theme toggle to cycle between Light and Dark only
5. Ensure all components properly support the two-theme system
6. Remove punk-specific color variables and consolidate color palette

FINAL COLOR REFINEMENT COMPLETE:

Updated the color scheme to use a more sophisticated dusty pink (#cfa5be) as the primary accent color instead of the previous coral pink. This creates a more mature, elegant aesthetic while maintaining the brutalist edge.

KEY COLOR CHANGES:
- Primary Accent: #cfa5be (dusty pink) - used sparingly for maximum impact
- Secondary Accent: #00d4ff (electric blue/cyan) - used even more sparingly 
- Tertiary Accent: #4ecdc4 (mint green) - minimal usage

UPDATED COMPONENTS:
1. CSS Variables (variables.scss): Updated all accent color definitions for both light and dark themes
2. Navigation Component: Updated theme configs to use dusty pink for buttons
3. Tailwind Config: Added dusty-pink color and reordered by priority
4. Global CSS: Updated RGB split text effects and glitch overlays to use new colors
5. AnimationDemo Component: Updated all color references in animations
6. Homepage: Updated button hover effects to use dusty pink

The new color scheme provides better contrast and sophistication while maintaining the strategic use of cyan as a secondary accent. The dusty pink works beautifully in both light and dark themes, creating a cohesive brand identity that's both professional and edgy.

## 4. Refine Color Strategy for Selective Impact [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the color system to be more selective and strategic, reducing overall color usage while maximizing impact through careful placement of accent colors and dynamic glow/light effects within glass layers.
### Details:
1. Audit current color usage across all components
2. Reduce accent color usage to strategic locations only (CTAs, key interactions, important content), with dynamic glow and lighting for hierarchy
3. Enhance monochrome base palette with more nuanced greys and glass backgrounds
4. Update design tokens to reflect refined color and glass strategy
5. Ensure accent colors create maximum visual impact through selective usage and light bending
6. Document color and glass usage guidelines for future development

Color Audit Findings

Current Color Usage Analysis:

Good Strategic Usage:
- Hero section dot: christopher. uses primary accent sparingly for impact
- CTA buttons: Primary accent used for main actions (Explore Services)
- Secondary buttons: Border-only usage maintains hierarchy
- Focus states: Consistent accent usage for accessibility

Areas for Improvement:

1. Too Many Accent Colors in Demo Section:
   - Using all 3 accent colors (primary, secondary, tertiary) in the same demo section
   - Lines 104, 121, 138 in index.astro show scattered accent usage
   - Should reduce to 1-2 accent colors max per section

2. Hardcoded Colors in AnimationDemo:
   - Multiple hardcoded hex values (#ff6b6b, #4ecdc4, #45b7d1, #f9ca24, #6c5ce7)
   - Should use design token variables instead
   - Demo section is too colorful - conflicts with selective strategy

3. Navigation Hardcoded Values:
   - Theme configs use hardcoded hex values instead of CSS variables
   - Should reference design tokens for consistency

4. Inconsistent Color References:
   - Some components use #fafafa hardcoded instead of text variables
   - 404 page uses different gradient colors not in design system

Strategic Refinements Needed:
1. Reduce accent color usage in demo section to 1 primary color
2. Convert hardcoded values to design token variables
3. Remove tertiary accent from most locations (save for very selective usage)
4. Enhance monochrome palette with more sophisticated greys
5. Create clear color usage guidelines

Next Steps: Start with demo section cleanup and hardcoded color conversion.
