# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the site for performance with lazy-loading images, Lighthouse score improvements, and implementation of sitemap.xml and RSS feed. Subtasks are organized by complexity from foundational optimizations to advanced monitoring.
# Details:
CORE OPTIMIZATION (Foundation):
1. Implement image optimization:
   - Use next/image or astro:assets for automatic optimization
   - Configure responsive image sizes
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen images
2. Optimize JavaScript:
   - Code splitting for large components
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
3. Optimize font loading with font-display: swap

CACHING & INFRASTRUCTURE:
4. Implement caching strategies:
   - Static generation where possible
   - Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
   - Browser caching headers
5. Add service worker for offline capability

SEO & CONTENT:
6. Create sitemap.xml generator
7. Implement RSS feed for content updates

MONITORING & VALIDATION:
8. Add performance monitoring:
   - Configure Core Web Vitals measurement
   - Set up Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
9. Comprehensive offline testing and validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Run Lighthouse audits targeting score â‰¥90 in all categories
2. Test performance on low-end devices and slow connections
3. Verify Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
4. Validate sitemap.xml format and content
5. Test RSS feed in feed readers
6. Measure and verify load time improvements
7. Test offline functionality with service worker

# Subtasks:
## 1. Image Optimization Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate automated image optimization for all assets, ensuring modern formats (WebP/AVIF), responsive sizing, and lazy loading. Use Astro's built-in image component and CDN delivery for all images sourced from Strapi 5.
### Details:
Configure Astro's image optimization pipeline to convert images to WebP/AVIF, generate multiple sizes for responsive loading, and implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images. Ensure Strapi 5 media endpoints deliver optimized images and set up CDN caching for static assets. Validate with Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals.

## 2. JavaScript Optimization and Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Reduce JavaScript bundle size and execution time using code splitting, tree-shaking, and deferred loading. Ensure only critical scripts are loaded initially.
### Details:
Leverage Astro's partial hydration and code splitting features to minimize client-side JS. Defer non-critical scripts using the 'defer' attribute. Remove unused dependencies and polyfills. Measure bundle size and TTI (Time to Interactive) before and after optimization.

## 3. Font Loading Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize font loading using modern CSS techniques: preload, font-display: swap, and subset fonts for minimal layout shift.
### Details:
Preload critical fonts using <link rel='preload'>, set font-display: swap in @font-face, and subset fonts to required glyphs. Test for FOIT/FOUT and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) impact. Validate with Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools.

## 4. Caching Strategies for Static and Dynamic Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement multi-layered caching: CDN, browser, and API-level for both static assets and Strapi 5 dynamic content. Set cache-control headers and validate cache hit rates.
### Details:
Configure AWS CloudFront (or similar CDN) for static assets and API endpoints. Set long-lived cache headers for immutable assets, and short-lived or revalidation strategies for dynamic content. Use Strapi middleware for HTTP caching and compression. Test with cache inspection tools and monitor cache hit/miss ratios.

## 5. Service Worker Setup for Offline Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Implement a service worker to enable offline access, asset caching, and background sync for key site features.
### Details:
Use Astro's PWA integration or Workbox to register a service worker. Cache static assets, critical API responses, and fallback pages. Test offline navigation and background sync. Measure repeat-visit load times and offline reliability.

## 6. Sitemap.xml Generation and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Automate sitemap.xml generation reflecting all public routes and Strapi 5 content. Ensure compliance with SEO best practices and accessibility standards.
### Details:
Use Astro's sitemap integration or a custom script to generate sitemap.xml on build, including dynamic routes from Strapi. Validate with Google Search Console and ensure all pages are crawlable and accessible. Test for correct lastmod, priority, and hreflang attributes.

## 7. RSS Feed Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provide an RSS feed for blog and news content sourced from Strapi 5, ensuring fast generation and standards compliance.
### Details:
Implement RSS feed generation in Astro, pulling structured content from Strapi's API. Validate feed with W3C Feed Validator. Ensure feed updates within 5 minutes of new content publication. Test with popular RSS readers.

## 8. Performance Monitoring and Alerting Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Integrate real-time performance monitoring using Lighthouse CI, Google PageSpeed Insights, and AWS CloudWatch. Set up alerts for performance regressions.
### Details:
Automate Lighthouse CI runs on every deployment. Connect Google Search Console and PageSpeed Insights for ongoing Core Web Vitals tracking. Use AWS CloudWatch for backend/API monitoring. Define alert thresholds for FCP, LCP, TTI, and server response times.

## 9. Lighthouse CI Integration and Automated Auditing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.8
### Description: Integrate Lighthouse CI into the CI/CD pipeline for automated performance, accessibility, and SEO audits on every deployment.
### Details:
Set up Lighthouse CI with custom thresholds for performance, accessibility, and SEO. Block deployments on regressions. Store audit reports for historical tracking. Ensure audits cover both desktop and mobile profiles.

## 10. Comprehensive Offline Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5, 10.9
### Description: Conduct thorough offline testing to ensure all critical features and content are accessible without network connectivity.
### Details:
Simulate offline scenarios using Chrome DevTools. Verify navigation, cached content, and fallback messaging. Test across devices and browsers. Document gaps and iterate on service worker caching strategies.
