# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the site for performance with lazy-loading images, Lighthouse score improvements, and implementation of sitemap.xml and RSS feed.
# Details:
1. Implement image optimization:
   - Use next/image or astro:assets for automatic optimization
   - Configure responsive image sizes
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen images
2. Add performance monitoring:
   - Configure Core Web Vitals measurement
   - Set up Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
3. Optimize JavaScript:
   - Code splitting for large components
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
4. Implement caching strategies:
   - Static generation where possible
   - Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
   - Browser caching headers
5. Create sitemap.xml generator
6. Implement RSS feed for content updates
7. Add service worker for offline capability
8. Optimize font loading with font-display: swap

# Test Strategy:
1. Run Lighthouse audits targeting score â‰¥90 in all categories
2. Test performance on low-end devices and slow connections
3. Verify Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
4. Validate sitemap.xml format and content
5. Test RSS feed in feed readers
6. Measure and verify load time improvements
7. Test offline functionality with service worker

# Subtasks:
## 1. Image Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compress, resize, and convert images to appropriate formats (JPEG, PNG, SVG, WebP) and implement responsive and lazy-loaded images.
### Details:
Use tools like TinyPNG or Compressor.io for compression. Ensure images are served in optimal formats and sizes for different devices. Implement lazy loading for offscreen images.

## 2. JavaScript Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Minify, combine, and defer JavaScript files to reduce load times and improve execution efficiency.
### Details:
Remove unnecessary characters and comments, combine scripts where possible, and defer non-critical scripts. Use tools like Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp for automation.

## 3. Caching Strategies Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure browser and server caching for static assets to reduce load times for repeat visitors.
### Details:
Set appropriate cache-control and expires headers for images, CSS, and JS. Consider using a CDN for distributed caching.

## 4. Performance Monitoring Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate tools to continuously monitor site performance and identify bottlenecks.
### Details:
Set up tools like Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or New Relic. Configure alerts for performance regressions.

## 5. Sitemap.xml Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and maintain a sitemap.xml file to improve search engine indexing and crawl efficiency.
### Details:
Generate a sitemap.xml reflecting all important site URLs. Automate updates as site structure changes.

## 6. RSS Feed Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and expose an RSS feed for site content to support syndication and user subscriptions.
### Details:
Generate an RSS feed that updates automatically with new content. Validate feed for compatibility.

## 7. Service Worker Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement a service worker to enable offline capabilities and advanced caching strategies.
### Details:
Register a service worker that caches key assets and enables offline access. Test for correct cache invalidation and updates.

## 8. Font Loading Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize web font loading to minimize render-blocking and improve perceived performance.
### Details:
Use font-display: swap, preload key fonts, and subset font files to reduce size and loading time.

## 9. Lighthouse CI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Integrate Lighthouse CI into the development workflow for automated performance audits.
### Details:
Set up Lighthouse CI to run on pull requests or deployments, generating reports and enforcing performance budgets.

## 10. Offline Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test site functionality and user experience in offline and poor network conditions.
### Details:
Simulate offline scenarios using browser DevTools and verify that critical features and pages remain accessible.
