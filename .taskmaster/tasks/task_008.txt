# Task ID: 8
# Title: Migrate Services Data to Strapi CMS with Structured Mapping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate all consulting service data (Virtual CIO, IT Support, Consulting, Project Management, Automation, Data Analysis, Cloud Migration, Cybersecurity, Website Development, Training, etc.) from services.md into Strapi, implement the tiered pricing matrix, pin/highlight logic, and connect the front-end to the Strapi API for dynamic, filterable, and sortable service display and detail pages. This task follows a complexity-based approach: Validation → Planning → Migration → API → CTA Logic → UI Components → UI Integration → Optimization.
# Details:
1. Ensure Service content model is properly configured in Strapi (fields for title, description, type, feature highlights, tiers, contactMethod, isPinned, slug, filtering, sorting, highlighting)
2. Migrate all static service data from services.md to Strapi, mapping fields and transforming as needed
3. Update front-end to fetch services from Strapi API and remove all static data
4. Implement tiered pricing display and filtering logic
5. Update service cards and detail pages to use dynamic data
6. Add contact CTAs (mailto or Calendly) based on contactMethod field
7. Implement caching strategy for service data
8. Update structured data for SEO with dynamic content
9. Ensure pin/highlight logic is respected in the UI
10. Integrate robust error handling and loading states for all dynamic content
11. Use CSS variables + Tailwind hybrid approach for all service UI components
12. Follow complexity-based execution order for risk mitigation and optimal implementation flow

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Strapi API integration works correctly
2. Test service rendering with various tier configurations
3. Validate CTA functionality based on contactMethod
4. Test caching and revalidation
5. Verify structured data generation
6. Test responsive layout with dynamic content
7. Validate error handling and loading states for API failures
8. Confirm pin/highlight logic is reflected in the UI
9. Review CSS variable and Tailwind integration in service UI
10. Validate execution order dependencies and parallel task completion
