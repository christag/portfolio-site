# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Portfolio Grid ('I Did')
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a filterable, accessible gallery of multi-media work that pulls content from Strapi and allows filtering by media type and tags. The grid must use a masonry, deliberately misaligned layout with punk/brutalist visual energy, and support theme toggles and expressive micro-interactions.
# Details:
1. Design and implement a masonry, asymmetric portfolio grid layout with deliberate misalignment and punk/industrial overlays
2. Create API service to fetch media items from Strapi, ensuring privacy and security
3. Implement accessible client-side filter bar with:
   - Media type filter (code, video, blog, audio, image)
   - Tag-based filtering
   - Sort options (date, popularity)
   - Controls must be usable by all, including non-technical users
   - Bold, oversized typography and punk-inspired accents
4. Create media card components for different content types, supporting creative/personal integration and micro-interactions (flickers, overlays, slide-ins)
5. Implement grid layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox, prioritizing accessibility, clarity, and controlled chaos
6. Add lazy loading for images and thumbnails
7. Implement caching strategy for API responses, respecting privacy
8. Add animation for card appearance using GSAP/Framer Motion (motion blur, glitch, slide-in), ensuring accessibility
9. Ensure filtering and grid logic are consistent with the services page for a cohesive, empowering UX

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Strapi API integration with mock data, ensuring privacy and security
2. Verify accessible filter functionality works correctly for all users
3. Test responsive, asymmetric grid layout and accessibility across device sizes
4. Validate performance with large number of items
5. Test accessible animations and transitions (motion blur, glitch, flicker)
6. Verify accessibility of filter controls and content parseability by AI/humans
7. Test cache invalidation when content updates

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Asymmetric Grid Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a visually striking, punk/brutalist-inspired grid layout using modern CSS (CSS Grid, masonry, and glassmorphism effects) to support dynamic, misaligned arrangements of media cards.
### Details:
Implement CSS Grid with custom row/column spans and intentional misalignment. Use glassmorphism (backdrop-filter, semi-transparent backgrounds, border-radius) for card backgrounds. Ensure the grid supports dynamic content and adapts to various screen sizes. Test with real and placeholder content for visual consistency.

## 2. Create Media Card Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Design reusable, glassmorphic media card components displaying images, titles, metadata, and interactive elements, supporting various media types from Strapi.
### Details:
Implement cards with semantic HTML, alt text for images, and support for video/audio if needed. Use CSS for glassmorphism and punk/brutalist accents. Ensure cards are focusable and interactive elements are accessible. Test with different media types and content lengths.

## 3. Integrate Strapi 5 API with Astro 5 [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Set up secure, efficient data fetching from Strapi 5 CMS using Astro's Content Loader API and/or Axios, supporting media, metadata, and filter categories.
### Details:
Configure Strapi 5 with the Media Library plugin and expose necessary endpoints. In Astro, create utility functions for fetching collections and single items, using environment variables for API URLs. Ensure support for media population and filtering. Test with mock and live data for reliability and error handling.

## 4. Set Up Caching and Data Fetch Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement caching strategies for API responses and media assets to reduce load times and server requests, leveraging Astro's SSR/static generation and AWS edge caching.
### Details:
Configure Astro to statically generate pages where possible. Use HTTP cache headers, service workers, and CDN (AWS CloudFront) for media. Test cache invalidation, stale-while-revalidate, and offline scenarios.

## 5. Develop Filter Bar Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Build an accessible, keyboard-navigable filter bar for categories/tags, enabling dynamic filtering of grid items via client-side state management.
### Details:
Use Astro Islands or a lightweight framework (e.g., React/Svelte) for interactivity. Implement ARIA roles, focus management, and visible focus indicators. Ensure filter state syncs with URL/query params for shareability. Test with keyboard, screen reader, and mouse navigation.

## 6. Implement Lazy Loading for Media and Grid Items [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Optimize initial load by lazy loading images and grid items using native browser features and Astro's partial hydration.
### Details:
Use the 'loading="lazy"' attribute for images and Intersection Observer for grid item hydration. Ensure smooth loading transitions and fallback for unsupported browsers. Test with slow network conditions and large datasets.

## 7. Add Animations and Micro-Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Enhance user experience with subtle, performant animations for grid transitions, filter changes, and card hover/focus states, reflecting the punk-meets-professional aesthetic.
### Details:
Use CSS transitions, keyframes, and Astro-compatible animation libraries (e.g., Framer Motion for React islands). Ensure animations respect user 'prefers-reduced-motion' settings. Test for jank-free, accessible motion.

## 8. Ensure Responsive Design Across Devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 6.7
### Description: Make the grid and all components fully responsive, supporting a wide range of devices and orientations with fluid layouts and touch-friendly interactions.
### Details:
Use CSS media queries, fluid units, and container queries. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Ensure touch targets are large enough and layouts adapt without horizontal scrolling.

## 9. Implement Accessibility (a11y) Standards [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8
### Description: Audit and enhance accessibility for all components, ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA standards and best practices for keyboard, screen reader, and color contrast.
### Details:
Add semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast. Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver), keyboard-only navigation, and accessibility audit tools (axe, Lighthouse).

## 10. Conduct Performance Testing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9
### Description: Test and optimize the grid page for fast load times, smooth interactivity, and minimal resource usage, targeting high Lighthouse scores and AWS deployment best practices.
### Details:
Use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Astro's built-in performance tools. Profile bundle size, image optimization, and hydration costs. Test on AWS deployment (S3/CloudFront) for real-world performance. Address bottlenecks and regressions.
