# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Portfolio Grid ('I Did')
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a filterable, accessible gallery of multi-media work that pulls content from Strapi and allows filtering by media type and tags. The grid must use a masonry, deliberately misaligned layout with punk/brutalist visual energy, and support theme toggles and expressive micro-interactions.
# Details:
1. Design and implement a masonry, asymmetric portfolio grid layout with deliberate misalignment and punk/industrial overlays
2. Create API service to fetch media items from Strapi, ensuring privacy and security
3. Implement accessible client-side filter bar with:
   - Media type filter (code, video, blog, audio, image)
   - Tag-based filtering
   - Sort options (date, popularity)
   - Controls must be usable by all, including non-technical users
   - Bold, oversized typography and punk-inspired accents
4. Create media card components for different content types, supporting creative/personal integration and micro-interactions (flickers, overlays, slide-ins)
5. Implement grid layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox, prioritizing accessibility, clarity, and controlled chaos
6. Add lazy loading for images and thumbnails
7. Implement caching strategy for API responses, respecting privacy
8. Add animation for card appearance using GSAP/Framer Motion (motion blur, glitch, slide-in), ensuring accessibility
9. Ensure filtering and grid logic are consistent with the services page for a cohesive, empowering UX

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Strapi API integration with mock data, ensuring privacy and security
2. Verify accessible filter functionality works correctly for all users
3. Test responsive, asymmetric grid layout and accessibility across device sizes
4. Validate performance with large number of items
5. Test accessible animations and transitions (motion blur, glitch, flicker)
6. Verify accessibility of filter controls and content parseability by AI/humans
7. Test cache invalidation when content updates

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Masonry/Asymmetric Grid Layout Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall grid layout structure, including breakpoints, column counts, spacing, and deliberate misalignment for accessibility and punk/brutalist visual energy.
### Details:
Plan how grid items will be arranged across different screen sizes, using CSS Grid/Flexbox for controlled chaos. Align with the services grid for a unified, bold look.

## 2. Integrate Strapi API [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Set up integration with the Strapi API to fetch dynamic content for the grid, ensuring privacy and security best practices.
### Details:
Implement API calls and data fetching logic to retrieve content from Strapi that will populate the grid layout. Ensure all data handling respects privacy and accessibility.

## 3. Implement Punk/Brutalist Filter Bar [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop an accessible filter bar component with bold, oversized typography and punk-inspired accents to allow users to filter grid items based on categories or tags.
### Details:
Connect filter bar state to grid data and ensure seamless, accessible filtering of content. Match filter UX with the services grid for consistency and boldness.

## 4. Create Media Card Components with Micro-interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Build reusable, accessible media card components to display individual content items within the grid, supporting technical, personal, and creative content, with punk-inspired micro-interactions.
### Details:
Design cards to display images, titles, descriptions, and other relevant metadata. Add flicker, glitch, or overlay effects for visual interest. Ensure accessibility and support for diverse content types.

## 5. Implement Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Add lazy loading functionality to load grid items as they enter the viewport, optimizing performance and accessibility.
### Details:
Optimize initial load time and improve performance by only rendering visible items. Ensure lazy loading is accessible and does not hinder usability.

## 6. Develop Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement a caching mechanism for Strapi API responses and grid data to reduce redundant network requests, respecting privacy and security.
### Details:
Use browser storage or in-memory caching to store fetched data and improve user experience. Ensure all caching strategies respect user privacy.

## 7. Set Up Animations with Motion Blur and Glitch Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Add accessible animations for grid item transitions, filtering, and loading states, using GSAP/Framer Motion for motion blur, glitch, and slide-in effects.
### Details:
Ensure smooth and visually impactful transitions when items are added, removed, or filtered. All animations must respect prefers-reduced-motion and accessibility guidelines.

## 8. Ensure Responsive Design with Deliberate Misalignment [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.4
### Description: Test and refine the grid layout and components to ensure optimal, accessible display on all device sizes, with deliberate misalignment for punk/brutalist energy.
### Details:
Adjust breakpoints, spacing, and component sizing for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Prioritize accessibility, clarity, and bold creative intent.

## 9. Implement Accessibility Features for Chaotic Layouts [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4, 6.8
### Description: Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support to all grid and filter components, with special attention to high-contrast and chaotic layouts.
### Details:
Ensure all interactive elements are accessible and comply with WCAG guidelines. Prioritize equity-driven design and empowerment.

## 10. Conduct Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9
### Description: Test the application for performance bottlenecks, including rendering speed, memory usage, and responsiveness, ensuring accessibility and privacy are not compromised.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to identify and address any issues affecting user experience, accessibility, or privacy.
