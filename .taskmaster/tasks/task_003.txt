# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Static Bio Page ('I Am')
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the 'I Am' bio page with contextual biography, timeline, and social links, reflecting authentic expertise, personal/professional duality, bold punk-meets-professional tone, and next-generation Liquid Glass interface principles. Use static markdown transformed at build time.
# Details:
1. Create a markdown file for the bio content, supporting both technical and personal storytelling
2. Implement a markdown transformer using remark/rehype or similar, ensuring accessibility and parseability by AI and humans
3. Design and build the bio page layout with:
   - Hero section with generative particle animation spelling out name, layered over glass material backgrounds
   - Header/profile section with split-personality (professional/rebellious) design, oversized sans-serif headings, code brackets, and floating glass panels
   - Contextual biography section highlighting honest partnership, empowerment, creative/professional integration, and spatial depth
   - Timeline/experience section with print-style, asymmetric grid, punk/industrial overlays, and glass/translucent layers
   - Social links with badges for community engagement, glitch effects, and glass backgrounds
4. Add SEO metadata (title, description, Open Graph tags) reflecting bold, direct brand values and spatial UI
5. Implement static generation for the page
6. Style the page according to the brutalist/punk and Liquid Glass design system, prioritizing accessibility, high contrast, expressive micro-interactions, and spatial adaptation
7. Ensure responsive behavior, deliberate misalignment, spatial depth, and accessibility across device sizes and AR/VR contexts

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate markdown rendering for various content elements, including technical, personal, and creative sections
2. Test responsive, asymmetric, and spatial layout and accessibility on different devices and AR/VR contexts
3. Verify social links and community engagement features open correctly and include punk/glass-inspired effects
4. Check SEO metadata using tools like Lighthouse, ensuring bold, brand-aligned, and spatial messaging
5. Validate accessibility compliance and parseability by both AI and humans

Technical Specs: Use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, prefers-reduced-motion support, and optimize animation for minimal JS. Testing: Check animation performance, accessibility (screen reader, keyboard navigation), and fallback for reduced motion.

## 5. Timeline/Experience Section Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop a timeline or experience section that visually communicates career milestones, using accessible markup and interactive or animated elements where appropriate.
### Details:
Deliverables: Astro component for timeline/experience, styled to match the overall aesthetic. Technical Specs: Use semantic HTML (e.g., <section>, <ul>, <li>), ARIA roles, and CSS for visual hierarchy. Testing: Accessibility audit (screen reader, keyboard), responsive behavior, and animation performance.

## 6. Social Links and SEO Metadata Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Integrate social media links with accessible icons and implement SEO metadata (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter cards, structured data) following 2025 best practices for headless CMS and static sites.
