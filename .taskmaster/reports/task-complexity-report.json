      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each configuration and integration step (repository setup, framework initialization, tooling, CI/CD, deployment, preview environments, 404/SEO, documentation) into atomic, testable subtasks. Include security, environment management, and rollback procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple tool integrations, environment configurations, and automation steps. Each step (repo, framework, tooling, CI/CD, deployment, SEO, docs) has dependencies and potential failure points, increasing cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. The number of moving parts and the need for robust testing and rollback justify a higher complexity score and granular subtasking."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Layout and Theme Components",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 12,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of core layout and theme components into granular subtasks covering: Tailwind CSS configuration for Liquid Glass, CSS variable setup for design tokens, creation of glass material utilities, responsive layout primitives, navigation/footer/header components, mobile menu, blending/merging effects, adaptive tinting, glass-specific animations, dynamic background generation, accessibility, cross-browser testing, and visual QA. Ensure each subtask addresses a specific technical or design requirement and includes clear acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need to deeply integrate Apple's Liquid Glass design principles—including dynamic, adaptive layering, low-opacity glass materials, strong blur, and spatial depth—across all foundational UI components. It requires advanced CSS (variables, specificity, backdrop-filter), custom Tailwind configuration, responsive design, accessibility, animation, and performance optimization. The need for blending effects, adaptive tinting, and strict adherence to a new visual language further increases complexity. Multiple rounds of refactoring and cross-browser QA are necessary to achieve the intended effect and maintain performance."
