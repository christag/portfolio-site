      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each configuration and integration step (repository setup, framework initialization, tooling, CI/CD, deployment, preview environments, 404/SEO, documentation) into atomic, testable subtasks. Include security, environment management, and rollback procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple tool integrations, environment configurations, and automation steps. Each step (repo, framework, tooling, CI/CD, deployment, SEO, docs) has dependencies and potential failure points, increasing cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. The number of moving parts and the need for robust testing and rollback justify a higher complexity score and granular subtasking."
