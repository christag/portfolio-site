      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each configuration and integration step (repository setup, framework initialization, tooling, CI/CD, deployment, preview environments, 404/SEO, documentation) into atomic, testable subtasks. Include security, environment management, and rollback procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple tool integrations, environment configurations, and automation steps. Each step (repo, framework, tooling, CI/CD, deployment, SEO, docs) has dependencies and potential failure points, increasing cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. The number of moving parts and the need for robust testing and rollback justify a higher complexity score and granular subtasking."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Layout and Theme Components",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 12,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of core layout and theme components into granular subtasks covering: Tailwind CSS configuration for Liquid Glass, CSS variable setup for design tokens, creation of glass material utilities, responsive layout primitives, navigation/footer/header components, mobile menu, blending/merging effects, adaptive tinting, glass-specific animations, dynamic background generation, accessibility, cross-browser testing, and visual QA. Ensure each subtask addresses a specific technical or design requirement and includes clear acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need to deeply integrate Apple's Liquid Glass design principles—including dynamic, adaptive layering, low-opacity glass materials, strong blur, and spatial depth—across all foundational UI components. It requires advanced CSS (variables, specificity, backdrop-filter), custom Tailwind configuration, responsive design, accessibility, animation, and performance optimization. The need for blending effects, adaptive tinting, and strict adherence to a new visual language further increases complexity. Multiple rounds of refactoring and cross-browser QA are necessary to achieve the intended effect and maintain performance."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Media Detail Page",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a dynamic media detail page that fetches content from Strapi and renders it based on media type. Include route handling, API integration, component rendering for different media types (markdown, video, code, image, audio), SEO metadata, social sharing, related content, and error handling. Consider accessibility, performance optimization, and responsive design for each media type.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex components: dynamic routing, API integration, conditional rendering based on media types, SEO optimization, and social features. The existing 9 subtasks appear well-structured, covering the essential aspects from routing setup to performance optimization."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Build Static Bio Page ('I Am')",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the bio page implementation to include markdown content creation, Astro content collections setup, punk/brutalist layout design with glassmorphism, hero section with particle animation, timeline/experience section, social links integration, SEO metadata, static generation configuration, responsive styling, and accessibility compliance. Focus on the dual personality theme and creative visual elements.",
      "reasoning": "While this is a static page, it requires complex visual design elements (particle animations, glassmorphism, punk aesthetic), multiple content sections, and careful attention to accessibility and SEO. The current 10 subtasks appropriately cover all aspects from content to deployment."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Migrate Services Data to Strapi CMS with Structured Mapping",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure the migration process following complexity-based ordering: first validate Strapi models and schemas, then plan migration strategy with backups, execute data migration with integrity checks, implement API integration and CTA logic, develop tiered pricing and filtering UI components, update service cards and detail pages, and finally optimize with caching and SEO. Ensure each phase builds on the previous for risk mitigation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a critical data migration task requiring careful planning, execution, and validation. It involves backend schema design, data transformation, API integration, complex UI features (filtering, sorting, tiered pricing), and performance optimization. The complexity-based approach in 8 subtasks is appropriate."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Collaboration Form ('We Could')",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the collaboration form implementation into: Jira Service Management project setup, analytics tracking integration, form page layout with glassmorphism design, validation and error handling, Jira iframe embedding, fallback form implementation for reliability, webhook integration for real-time updates, and success/thank-you flow. Ensure accessibility and cross-browser compatibility throughout.",
      "reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward (embedding a form), this task involves third-party integration (Jira), fallback mechanisms, webhook setup, and proper error handling. The 8 subtasks appropriately cover setup, implementation, integration, and user experience aspects."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Add Animation and Micro-interactions",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure animation implementation by complexity: setup animation library and configuration, implement prefers-reduced-motion support as foundation, create animations by type (page transitions, element animations, micro-interactions), develop custom hooks and utilities, implement lazy-loading for performance, build reusable animation components, and validate accessibility and performance. Ensure each animation respects user preferences and enhances rather than hinders usability.",
      "reasoning": "Animation implementation requires careful balance between visual enhancement and performance/accessibility. The complexity comes from library integration, accessibility considerations, performance optimization, and creating reusable patterns. The 7 subtasks follow a logical progression from setup to validation."

      "taskId": 12,
      "taskTitle": "Implement PWA Capabilities",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement PWA features in layers: create manifest.json and generate app icons as foundation, implement service worker for offline functionality, handle install prompts for user engagement, set up push notifications with Strapi/AWS integration, implement offline content sync and background sync for enhanced functionality, conduct cross-device testing, and run Lighthouse PWA audit for validation. Each layer should build upon the previous for a robust implementation.",
      "reasoning": "PWA implementation involves multiple technical aspects: manifest configuration, service worker development, push notifications, offline sync, and extensive testing across devices. The structured approach from foundation to advanced features in 8 subtasks ensures proper implementation order and comprehensive coverage."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement the dynamic services page systematically: define Strapi content model for services with all required fields, develop service card components with glassmorphism design, implement responsive grid/list layout, set up dynamic routing for detail pages, add tiered pricing display and filtering logic, design caching strategy for performance, ensure responsive and accessible design throughout, implement SEO and structured data, add robust error handling, and conduct comprehensive integration testing. Each component should support the punk-meets-professional aesthetic.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks, requiring full-stack implementation from CMS modeling to frontend rendering. It includes complex features like filtering, sorting, tiered pricing, dynamic routing, and must maintain design consistency while ensuring accessibility. The 10 subtasks appropriately cover all aspects of this comprehensive feature."
