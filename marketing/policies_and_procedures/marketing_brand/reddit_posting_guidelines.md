### Reddit (Tech, Business, and Creative Hobby Subreddits)

- **Content Style:** Authentic, helpful, and modest. Always act as an individual offering free advice and insights — never as a business pushing services. The community highly values transparency and suspicion of commercial intent.  
- **Trend & Viral Content:** Regularly browse subreddits’ “hot” and “rising” tabs to spot trending questions or topics. Provide unique, well-thought-out contributions that support the community’s needs.  
- **Engaging Other Users:** Respond to questions with detailed answers or resource links without overt branding. If complex advice is warranted, break it into parts over multiple comments or invite private discussion through Reddit’s direct messaging.  
- **Subreddits to Target:**  
  - Tech & IT: r/sysadmin, r/networking, r/itprofessionals, r/devops  
  - Business & Startups: r/startups, r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur, r/productmanagement  
  - Creative Hobbies: r/customsneakers, r/sneakerheads, r/digitalart, r/DIY  
- **Subtle Advertising / Professional Reveal:** Let curiosity lead. Show expertise through detailed, helpful posts; allow the community to discover your professional background gradually (via Reddit profile or private message) rather than self-disclosure upfront. Share tools, workflows, and free resources generously.  
- **Community Norms:** Strictly follow subreddit rules on self-promotion and flair usage. Avoid reposting the same content across subreddits or spamming. Engage sincerely and frequently to build reputation and karma authentically.
