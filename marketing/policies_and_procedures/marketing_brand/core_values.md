## Core Values

- **Empowerment Through Knowledge:** Power comes from clear, actionable guidance. My goal is to equip clients with the skills and understanding to own their technology and product decisions confidently.
- **Focus on Founders & Small Businesses:** Working primarily with individuals and small teams outside tech, I prioritize practical, tailored solutions for non-technical leaders seeking automation and operational leverage.
- **Honest Partnership:** Transparency and no-nonsense advice build trust. I commit to upfront, value-driven recommendations aligned tightly with clients’ true business goals.
- **Sustainable Growth, Not Quick Profits:** My work centers on scalable, sustainable business processes rather than chasing short-term gain or empty growth metrics.
- **Customer Experience Matters:** Delivering white-glove, human-centric service models creates delight and loyalty, reinforcing the core of successful business.
- **Privacy, Security & Openness:** Respect for user privacy is fundamental. Open-source solutions, when appropriate, are preferred to proprietary alternatives to ensure transparency and innovation.
- **Collaboration & Understanding:** I always start by asking “why” to understand the real problems before designing solutions, fostering collaboration that respects clients’ needs.
- **Personal & Professional Integration:** My brand and business are one—combining deep technical credentials, personal anecdotes, and practical advice to offer a uniquely authentic perspective and service.
- **Solo & Fractional, Scalable Impact:** While I work solo and fractionally, my mission is to empower clients with processes and tools that enable their own sustainable growth and scaling.
