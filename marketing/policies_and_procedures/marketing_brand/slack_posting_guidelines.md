### Slack Groups (e.g., Founder and Small Business Communities)

- **Content Style:** Professional, helpful, and conversational. Aim to be a knowledgeable peer sharing concise, actionable advice relevant to founders and small business leaders.
- **Trend & Viral Content:** Keep an eye on frequently discussed pain points or emerging trends from members. Adapt your expertise to offer fresh, practical perspectives or workflows that address those urgent needs.
- **Engaging Other Members:** Actively participate in discussions by answering questions, suggesting resources, and sharing personal lessons learned without overt self-promotion. Build rapport over time through consistent value contribution.
- **Hashtag Use:** Slack typically does not support hashtags for discoverability; instead, use well-formatted messages and clear subject lines when sharing resources.
- **Communities & Channels:** Join multiple relevant Slack workspaces with a focus on startup founders, SaaS, IT consulting, and small business tech. Observe community norms carefully before posting.
- **Subtle Advertising:** Avoid direct promotion. Instead, share solutions or workflows that demonstrate expertise naturally, offering additional help if privately asked. Use “if you want to connect or dive deeper, feel free to DM me” rather than broadcasting services publicly.
