### Facebook

- **Content Style:** Balanced between professional and casual to engage both personal and business audiences. Use storytelling and community-oriented posts.  
- **Trend & Viral Content:** Follow pages and groups related to small business, IT consulting, and technology innovation for viral ideas; adapt posts with brand tone and additional insight.  
- **Engaging Other Brands:** Comment on posts of relevant pages, share content with added context, and participate in Facebook Groups as a valued contributor.  
- **Hashtag Use:** Use sparingly; Facebook doesn’t rely heavily on hashtags but 1–2 relevant tags may increase visibility.  
- **Communities & Groups:** Actively post and interact in small business and tech-related groups, always adding value rather than overt marketing.  
- **Subtle Advertising:** Share client problem-solving stories or project retrospectives as experience-sharing rather than sales pitches.
