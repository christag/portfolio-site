### TikTok

- **Content Style:** Short, punchy, visually engaging videos that focus on “wow” moments in tech automation or light, brand-appropriate humor and memes.
- **Trend & Viral Content:** Regularly browse the “For You” page and popular sounds. Adapt trends by integrating them with brand’s ironic, clever angle on work and technology. Use trending sounds where it feels natural and on-brand.
- **Engaging Other Brands:** Collaborate occasionally on joint challenges or duets with other creators in tech or creative fields. Comment and engage with relevant influencers.
- **Hashtag Use:** Use trending and niche hashtags (#automationtips, #techforgood, #workflowhacks) to boost video discovery.
- **Communities:** Leverage TikTok’s comment threads to build dialogue.
- **Subtle Advertising:** Demonstrate value through quick demos or relatable tech frustrations/solutions rather than direct promotion.
