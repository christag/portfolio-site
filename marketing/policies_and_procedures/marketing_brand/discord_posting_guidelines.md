### Discord Channels (Tech, Startup, and Creative Communities)

- **Content Style:** Friendly, engaging, and informal while remaining professional. Leverage Discordâ€™s more real-time and casual nature to foster genuine relationships and spontaneous interactions.
- **Trend & Viral Content:** Monitor active discussions, pinned posts, and announcements to identify hot topics. Participate in voice chats or live Q&As when possible to increase presence and authenticity.
- **Engaging Other Members:** Provide thoughtful answers to technical questions, share insights in relevant channels (e.g., automation, product management, digital art). Encourage collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas among members.
- **Hashtag Use:** Discord does not generally use hashtags; instead, rely on channel categorization and clear post structure.
- **Communities & Channels:** Target servers that focus on startups, fractional leadership, AI workflows, and creative hobbies like sneaker customization or digital art.
- **Subtle Advertising:** Integrated into natural conversations only when asked or when sharing a helpful resource. Avoid unsolicited promotional posts. Offer to support or collaborate privately when relevant.
