### X (Twitter)

- **Content Style:** Conversational, witty, and immediate. Focus on sharing quick thoughts, ironic commentary, engaging tech news, and niche memes aligned with brand voice.  
- **Trend & Viral Content:** Daily scan trending hashtags and viral tweets related to tech, business, AI, and social justice. Retweet selectively adding personal spin or counterpoints. Participate in relevant Twitter chats or threads.  
- **Engaging Other Brands:** Reply quickly and insightfully to peers and influencers; quote tweet with clever commentary. Join conversations with brands by acknowledging their value or debating ideas constructively.  
- **Hashtag Use:** Use 2–4 hashtags focused on reach (#Automation, #TechEthics, #SmallBiz). Leverage trending hashtags when genuinely relevant but avoid hashtag stuffing.  
- **Communities:** Join Lists or use Twitter Spaces for interactive community engagement.  
- **Subtle Advertising:** Tweet useful tips or AI workflows demonstrating value, avoid direct service promotion. Example: “Here’s a quick n8n workflow that saved me hours handling job application notifications. DM if you want a run-through!”
