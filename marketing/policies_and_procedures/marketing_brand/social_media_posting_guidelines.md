## 2. General Best Practices

- **Authenticity First:** Never force trends or brand alignment; only adapt viral content that fits organically with voice and values.
- **Value Before Promotion:** Prioritize educating, entertaining, or empowering the audience over directly selling services.
- **Consistent Engagement:** Build lasting connections by regularly commenting, sharing, and collaborating—not just posting.
- **Hashtag Discipline:** Use hashtags strategically for discovery without clutter or detracting from core messages.
- **Community Respect:** Observe and participate respectfully in groups and discussions, abiding by community rules.

## 3. Posting Content Mix

Maintain a balanced rotation of content types aligned with the Content Strategy Framework:

| Content Type                    | Description                                                               | Frequency       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Personal Stories & Reflections  | Humanize the brand with authentic anecdotes, struggles, wins.             | 20–25% of posts |
| Technical Insights & Workflows  | Share valuable how-tos, project highlights, and case studies.             | 25–30% of posts |
| Creative Ventures & Hobbies     | Show off cross-disciplinary creativity to foster connection.              | 10–15% of posts |
| Thought Leadership & Commentary | Discuss industry trends, systemic critiques, and values.                  | 20–25% of posts |
| Community Engagement & Memes    | Engage with niche humor, memes, and discussions aligned with brand voice. | 10–15% of posts |

_Note:_ Content on all primary platforms (LinkedIn, X, Facebook) should closely align or be essentially the same with slight platform-appropriate adjustments for format and tone.

## 4. Tone & Style Guidelines

- **Clear & Direct:** Use plain language that is easily understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Warm & Empathetic:** Speak as a relatable human expert—acknowledge real-world challenges with kindness.
- **Dry, Wry Humor:** Employ irony and subtle humor consistently but tastefully; avoid overuse or content that could alienate.
- **Rebellious But Respectful:** Challenge systemic failings and power structures without attacking individuals or clients.
- **Inclusive & Equitable:** Use language that honors accessibility and social justice principles; avoid jargon or insider slang that excludes.
- **Consistent Brand Personality:** Posts should amplify the integrated brand attributes: knowledgeable, honest, approachable, creative, socially conscious, and empowering.

---

## 5. Content Creation & Approval Process

- **Ideation:** Use the approved Content Pillars as a base. Topics should align with business goals, recent projects, or timely industry issues.
- **Drafting:** Posts should be reviewed for alignment with brand voice and messaging principles before publication.
- **Multimedia:** Use images, videos, and screenshots to increase engagement and clarify technical content. Ensure images reflect diversity and inclusiveness.
- **Scheduling:** Post consistently according to the cadence defined in the Content Strategy Framework. Avoid posting multiple times per day on the same platform to prevent audience fatigue.

---

## 6. Engagement & Interaction

- **Active Listening:** Monitor all channels daily for comments, questions, and messages. Respond thoughtfully and promptly to foster community.
- **Encourage Dialogue:** Invite questions and discussions, especially around technical topics and social impact.
- **Community Support:** Amplify client wins, industry peers, and relevant social causes aligned with brand values.
- **Collaborate & Share:** Regularly engage with other brands and viral posts by commenting meaningfully, sharing where appropriate, and joining conversations without losing brand identity.

---

## 7. Handling Sensitive Topics & Critique

- **Systemic Critique:** Maintain the wry, ironic tone describing capitalist, political, and systemic absurdities without descending into vitriol or alienation.
- **Avoiding Polarization:** Do not endorse or oppose political parties or controversial figures explicitly; maintain a nonpartisan solidarity with people over power.
- **Dealing With Negative Feedback:** Respond with empathy, humor where appropriate, and a reaffirmation of brand values. Avoid engaging in hostile or trolling interactions.
- **Privacy & Security:** Never share confidential or sensitive client information. Uphold privacy and security values in all posts.

---

## 8. Calls to Action (CTAs)

- Frame CTAs around delivering value first—e.g., offering insights, free resources, or collaborative opportunities.
- Avoid pushy or sales-heavy language; position all CTAs as invitations to join conversations or explore solutions collaboratively.
- Always connect the CTA back to client empowerment, learning, or making meaningful impact.

---

## 9. Prohibited Content & Behavior

- No partisan political endorsements or attacks.
- No disrespectful or divisive language targeting individuals or groups.
- No oversharing of personal information that compromises privacy.
- Avoid off-brand memes or viral fads that conflict with personality or professionalism.

---

## 10. Performance Monitoring & Optimization

- Track engagement metrics monthly, including likes, shares, comments, reach, and follower growth.
- Regularly review which content types and tones resonate best and adjust the mix accordingly.
- Periodically solicit audience feedback and monitor sentiment for ongoing refinement of style and messaging.
